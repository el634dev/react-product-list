Binary Search - Easy

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. 
If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Binary Search is defined as a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. 
The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(log N

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

Example 2:

Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1

"""
Binary Search Algorithm: 👈
In this algorithm,
    1. Divide the search space into two halves by finding the middle index “mid”.
        a.To Find the mid, assign the value of low + (high - low) / 2
    2. Compare the middle element of the search space with the key.

    3. If the key is found at middle element, the process is terminated.

    4. If the key is not found at middle element, choose which half will be used as the next search space.

    5. If the key is smaller than the middle element, then the left side is used for next search.

    6. If the key is larger than the middle element, then the right side is used for next search.

    7. This process is continued until the key is found or the total search space is exhausted.
